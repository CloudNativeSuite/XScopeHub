This repository hosts multiple components:

- `observe-bridge/` – core observability bridge services and supporting code.
- `LLM-Agent/` – placeholder for an upcoming LLM-based operations agent.
- `agents/` – external agent integrations (deepflow, node_exporter, process-exporter, vector).
- `openobserve` and `opentelemetry-collector` – external dependencies tracked as submodules.
